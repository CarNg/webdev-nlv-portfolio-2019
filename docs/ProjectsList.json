Project details are generated via a JSON file that is hosted on github and images are held in the public folder. This allows me to add projects without having to rebuild every time."

It is inspired by YouTube channel SourceFedNERD’s Table Talk series, Apollo Robbins' TED Talk on 'The Art of Misdirection' and introversion. I had been reading about introversion when I came across the quote 'Introverts do not hate small talk because we dislike people. We hate small talk because we hate the barrier it creates between people.' That was something that I related to so strongly that I wanted to design a game that would allow people to skip the small talk and encourage us to listen to and give players the opportunity to get to know each other and share their stories.",
            "Gameplay":"So how does this storytelling card game work? Each card will have two parts - Talk and Listen. Talk is the conversation topic and Listen is a question relating to the topic. Let's use a simple example: Talk may be ‘Discuss your favourite movie and why.’ and Listen may be ‘Who is the director of my favourite movie?’. The first player, we'll call him James, will draw a card and share what's on the Talk side with the rest of the group. The Listen side is for James to know only and not shared with the group. For the next *five minutes, the group will discuss their favourite movie. During this time, James must clearly mention who the director of his favourite movie is (as mentioned on the Listen side) at least twice. James' objective is to do so subtly cause his goal is the misdirect the other players from the real question. He can do this by steering the conversation away from the director or appear to focus on other aspects of the movie more. Meanwhile, the other players are trying to figure out what the question is and remember the answer. All the while, trying to distract the other players from doing the same. Once every player has had a go, in the same order the cards were drawn, the question on the Listen side of the cards will now be asked by the player who drew the card. In this example, James will now ask ‘Who is the director of my favourite movie?’. For each wrong answer, James will get a point. For every answer a player gets right, they get two points. This will continue till all players have asked their question. Play restarts and continues and the first player to reach *10 points wins.",
            "Customise":"*You can tweak the rules! ABST! is flexible and there are many variants that can be tailored to suit the environment you’re playing in. The above is simply a guideline. You can vary how long each discussion is and how many points are required to win. You can even switch it up by changing the winning conditions altogether. You can have most points after x amount of rounds or maybe it's game night or a dinner party and you want conversation to flow all night; you can eliminate time limits altogether. For example, at the start of the night, each participant draws a card each and conversations on those topics carry on throughout the night. At the end of the night, the questions are asked and the best listener wins! Of course, the topics are entirely customisable too! You can always make your own topics too, hypothetical or factual. The stories you share can be real or they can be made up too. The answers can be as serious or as silly and light-hearted as you want. That’s all up to you, make it suit your game group, have fun with it! If you give the game a go, I'd love to hear about it. Happy conversing!",
            "Experience": "Like I said, ABST! is the first game I designed solo and it's one that has a soft spot in my heart. The game itself is still only an idea and one with no real playtesting. However, it is still a personal favourite because as the design grew, so did my passion for game design. The prospect of making and sharing this game was thrilling. Not only was I designing a game that I wanted to play, I was designing it based on something I cared about deeply and couldn't wait to share."

So to overcome this, random triggers were added to the speed and direction of the teacher to add some unpredictability.

The inspiration for the story of This Time Around is actually a personal one. As someone who has trouble remembering their childhood, the idea of discovering it all again (essentially, for the first time) was fascinating to me and I wanted to pursue the idea that by revisiting your past you can learn and see things in a new perspective that you may have never considered before. As a player, you adopt the characters you play. Often times, players don't know the characters' history or background and you discover these things on your own and in your own time. Much like if I were to delve into my own childhood, most of which I don't remember, and that's how This Time Around came to be.",
            "Gameplay":"Players (re)discover memories as Rachel Daniels in This Time Around, learning things she may have forgotten or have never examined before through letters and objects throughout the game world.

Good or bad, we learn from them, and This Time Around aims to be that reminder.",

            "Experience": "The project was invaluable in terms of the things it taught me. Not only did I learn endless ways of problem solving in game development and how to code practically; with endless hours of researching and experimenting, I also learned how to develop a game design idea into a completed game through playtesting and a number of iterations. The project was iterated using a design-build-test cycle and that was the biggest learning experience of all. The cycle allowed me to understand user needs and the importance of playtesting and refining accordingly. In order to create a game for the target audience, this playtest and refinement cycle is vital. There is no doubt that the things I learned from this project can and will be carried forward to future projects."

Weekly meetings allowed us to present our individual ideas and research and discuss our next steps together, this allowed for a great, encouraging and supportive environment and allowed for a smooth process in producing Circuits."

            "Summary":"The first step in designing Hopscotch 2 was to examine hopscotch and determine what the weaknesses were. We found that the main flaw of the game is its repetition and lack of player interaction. So our goal was to add variety and randomness to the game and to add player interaction. We achieved this by adding ways to affect other players and making the 'track' random.",
            "Gameplay":"The 'track' of Hopscotch 2 is made up of separate piece (this can be pieces of foam or paper). Each piece will have its own colour and be associated with a single element. The track is constructed in a randomised pattern and each player is assigned an element. The starting element on the track will determine which players' turn it is. This player must hop to the end of the track using only the pieces associated with their element. When they are on their second piece, they must pick up the starting piece on the track (they can stand on two feet but must not fall off) and carry it with them till the end of the track. Once they are there, they must place it down at the end. Therefore, creating a new pattern. Each player also gets a single use 'stone' that can be used to help them on more difficult patterns. Players may toss the stone on the track which will allow them to then hop on the piece that the stone lands on regardless of element type. If a player falls or steps on the wrong element, they are eliminated along with all their element pieces on the track. The aim is to be the last one standing.",
            "Responsibilities":"Hopscotch 2 was a group project between me, Aisling Flynn, Philippa Kelly and Diana Volovei. The game was researched, designed and playtested collectively. However, the artwork in the images above was provided by Diana.",
            "Experience": "We found that the new elements (pun intended) added to the game made it more fun and significantly more engaging. It created more interaction between players as other players' turn would affect the 'track' which also added strategy into the game. The changing of the tracks also made the game more challenging as player elimination would increase the difficulty. Player elimination was originally a concern of ours but it didn't become a problem since games were often short (and its fun watching people struggling not to fall too). The project was an interesting and informative exercise in game design. Being able to examine a game, find the weaknesses and come up with solutions is a vital skill and this project was a great example of that."

            "Summary":"Pigeon Invasion was a three month project that was aimed to gain experience in the full process of creating an app from scratch to releasing the game on the App Store and promoting the game afterwards.",
            "Gameplay":"Since three months was a short amount of time to create and publish an app from scratch, we chose to base the game's basic mechanics and design on an existing game. This allowed us to hit the ground running and Pigeon Invasion is based on the classic 'Choplifter'. Players play as a pigeon, flying through parks, streets and abandoned factories in order to collect food for their babies. All the while, they must avoid a number of obstacles such as angry dogs, menacing teenagers and toxic waste. It borrows the mechanics of Choplifter but applies it to a fun and humorous setting.",
            "Responsibilities":"Pigeon Invasion was a three person project that consisted of me, Michiel Rheiter and Gabriel Pavan. Michiel was the art designer and Gabriel worked on the project as the audio and level designer. Finally, I worked on the app as the programmer and producer. The game was developed in GameSalad and my role involved implementing the controls and mechanics of the game as well as applying the art and audio work received from other team members into the game. My role also included setting the tasks each week in order to keep the project on schedule. As we were working on a tight schedule it was vital that we met our marks each week.",
            "Experience": "Pigeon Invasion was my first group development project and it was a major learning experience in that sense. It showed the importance of establishing roles, communication and team work. It was clear that those aspects were able to make or break a project and a team. Understanding the importance of communication and team work allowed for much smoother group projects in the future. Pigeon Invasion was also my first experience with game testing and refining. The mechanics of the game, although based on Choplifter, took many iterations due to the translation from console controls to touchscreen controls. What the team initially taught would be relatively simple turned into a much larger and tedious task and many iterations were made during development as a result. It was also a great example on the importance of controls design and testing as it can change a game entirely."
